# Workpay

**Workpay** is an application for logging employee work and calculating remuneration. Each employee can record details of the work they have done, including task descriptions, hours worked, hourly rates, and additional costs (if any). If the work is performed by multiple employees, the remuneration will be prorated based on each employee's contribution in hours worked.
